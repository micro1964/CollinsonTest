# CollinsonTest
Recruitment Exercise

Both Tasks were written in Java and Cucumber used as the BDD approach.
Both tasks were created in the same project. The project is mavenised hence maven is a dependency
The Vending Machine App can be run as a Java Application from the IDE to involve User Interaction using the Scanner to get User Prompts
The Testsuite can be run in various ways:
1 - From IDE, Right click on TestRunner.java (exists in \src\test\java\runner) to Run as JUnit Tests
2 - From IDE, Right click on pom.xml (exists in root of the project)
3 - From command Line, navigate to root folder and type "mvn test"

A Test Report is created each time the tests run (Location: \target\cucumber-reports\report.html). The latest report currently overwrites previous runs

Please watch the video named WATCH_ME.mp4 for a visual description and demo of running the Vending App and various methods of running the TestStuite

Thanks
